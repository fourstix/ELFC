# ELFC
A C compiler for a CDP1802 based microcomputer running Elf/OS or Mini/DOS.  ElfC is based on SubC written by Nils M Holms.

Installation
-------------
* Unzip the file elfc_r21.zip into the desired directory
* Copy the file `hello.c` into the directory.
* Use the command *elfc hello.c* to compile the `hello.c` to `hello.elfos`
* Transfer the `hello.elfos` file to a microcomputer running Elf/OS or Mini/DOS.
* Make the file executable using the *chmod +x hello.elfos* command
* Run the command *hello.elfos* to view the "Hello, World!" message

Design Goals
-------------
* Use the [Asm/02](https://github.com/fourstix/Asm-02) assembler and the [Link/02](https://github.com/fourstix/Link-02) linker to produce CDP1802 binary code to run as an Elf/OS or Mini/DOS program
* Create a library based on Mike Riley's [Library/02](https://github.com/rileym65/Library-02) standard library.
* Target both Elf/OS and Mini/DOS as a platform.
* Target Windows and Linux as the development platform (cross-compiler)
* Use an expression stack similar to the one implemented in Mike Riley's Fortran/02 program.
* Minimize changes to basic SubC compiler code and prefer changes to the code generation and library code functions.
* Implement the code generation functions first, migrate to the latest version of SubC and then work on implementing the C libraries.
* Extend the SubC code to cover additional C keywords and functions.

Release 1
----------

This version is based on the [SubC book version, 2nd Ed.](https://www.t3x.org/subc/README-2nd-ed.html) described in the book [Practical Compiler Construction](https://www.t3x.org/reload/index.html) by Nils M Holms.

I strongly recommend reading Nils's book.  Practical Compiler Construction is a very good guide in explaining the theory behind the SubC compiler as well as describing the compiler's code.  The second edition can be ordered as a [paperback](https://www.lulu.com/en/us/shop/nils-m-holm/practical-compiler-construction/paperback/product-179kp29q.html) or [pdf ebook file](https://www.lulu.com/en/us/shop/nils-m-holm/practical-compiler-construction/ebook/product-18knr78q.html) from Lulu press.

In Release 1 the code generation functions for Elf/OS and Mini/DOS have all been implemented.  The arithmetic and logical operators have all been implemented and tested.


Release 2
----------
This release migrates the code base to the current [Experimental SubC](https://www.t3x.org/subc/index.html) version so that the code generator can include structures, unions and typedefs.

This release supports some basic code optimization as described in the book [Practical Compiler Construction](https://www.t3x.org/reload/index.html) by Nils M Holms

The compiler supports the [Asm/02](https://github.com/fourstix/Asm-02) and [Link/02](https://github.com/fourstix/Link-02) linker better, and included files and libraries are better organized.

The C runtime module `crt0` now holds the start-up code for the program.  The start up code now pushes the expected command line arguments for `main` onto the stack (`int argc` and `char **argv`) and then calls the main function.

An additional compiler option `-L` will compile and assemble Elf/OS (Min/iDOS) library modules from C files.

The stdlib, stdio, ctype, and string C libraries are supported as described in the book [Practical Compiler Construction](https://www.t3x.org/reload/index.html) by Nils M Holms.

* The C libraries are created from C files using the ElfC (`-L`) library compile option.

* The header files use `#pragma` statements so the libraries link properly.

More information about unsupported library functions, header files and ElfC internals can be found on the [ELFC Detailed Information](ELFC.md) page.

Release 2.5
------------

This release adds an implementation of the C time library to ElfC, and a compiler option -N to compile without linking the C stdlib and stdio libraries.

More information about the time library functions, header files and ElfC internals can be found on the [ELFC Detailed Information](ELFC.md) page.

Release 2.1
------------

This release passes all the functional tests from the [Experimental version of SubC](https://www.t3x.org/subc/index.html).  No new function was added to this release, only a few minor issues were fixed in this release.  The functional test cases are included in this release.

Version 2
----------

* Version 2 implements the code generation functions required to compile a C file and assemble the resulting CDP1802 assembly and link code files into a binary program for the Elf/OS (Mini/DOS) operating system.

* The assembler [Asm/02]((https://github.com/fourstix/Asm-02)) and linker [Link/02](https://github.com/fourstix/Link-02) are now invoked with the same path as the compiler.  The C library files and header files are located in the same manner, so that the preprocessor commands `#include <header.h>` and `#include "header.h"` work as expected.

* Version 2 extends the library of arithmetic and variable functions based on the  16-bit standard library [Library/02](https://github.com/rileym65/Library-02) to manipulate values on an expression stack.

* This version implements the changes to the book compiler code contained in the latest current [Experimental version of SubC](https://www.t3x.org/subc/index.html).

* The peep-hole code optimizations are all implemented except for the 386 assembly code Type Synthesis optimizations which have no equivalents available in 1802 assembly code.  In the discussion *RISC vs CISC* on page 362 of [Practical Compiler Construction](https://www.t3x.org/reload/index.html), Nils M Holm covers this topic in more detail.

* In addition to these optimizations, jump optimizations and push / pop optimizations were added that are specific to 1802 assembly code.  Constant folding and AST trees are supported as in the [Experimental SubC](https://www.t3x.org/subc/index.html) code.

* The `asm` statement passes a string literal directly into the generated assembly file.

* The `#pragma` preprocessor directive can be used to directly insert an assembly directive or a line of assembly code directly into the generated assembly file.

* The `__LINE__` and `__FILE__` preprocessor directives were implemented in this version.

* The arguments `int argc` and `char **argv` are now available as arguments to main.  Up to eight arguments are supported.  The argument `argv[0]` points to the command string that invoked the program.

* The `stdlib`, `stdio`, `ctype`, and `string` are supported.

* The ElfC compiler now accepts inline comments (`// comments`) as well as traditional C commments (`/* comments */`).

* The ElfC compiler now accepts `\e` as an escape sequence for the ASCII escape character 0x1B.

* `struct`, `union` and `typedef` are now supported, except as function arguments and function return values.

* Pointers to `struct`, `union` and `typedef` are now supported. A function may accept a *pointer* to a `struct` or `union` and a function may return a *pointer* to a `structure` or `union`.

* `&array` is now valid syntax (you no longer have to write `&array[0]`).

* The `auto`, `register`, and `volatile` keywords are recognized (as no-ops).

* `enum`'s may now be local.

* `extern` identifiers may now be declared locally.

* Prototypes may have the `static` storage class.

* The `#error`, `#line`, and `#pragma` commands have been added.

* The `atexit()` mechanism is now supported.

* The `varags` mechanism is now supported as functions as described in the book [Practical Compiler Construction](https://www.t3x.org/reload/index.html) by Nils M Holms.

* The `assert` macro is implemented as a function with support for the `NDEBUG` macro.

* STG ROM break points are supported by the `_STGROM_` and `BRKPT` macros.

* A broader subset of C expression syntax is accepted in constant expression contexts. Pointer variables can be initialized with NULL.

More information about unsupported library functions, header files and ElfC internals can be found on the [ELFC Detailed Information](ELFC.md) page.


Compiler Option Changes
-----------------------
* Added the `-L` (Library) ElfC option to compile and assemble a C source file into a prg file defining an Elf/OS (Mini/DOS) library procedure.

* The `-N` (No libraries) option compiles without the stdio and stdlib C libraries.  The user should supply the _init() function that is called by ElfC before the main function.

* Simplified the `-V` (Verbose) option to display *all* verbose messages or none. There is no longer any need to specify multiple verbose options for additional messages.

More information about `-L` Library option can be found on the [ELFC Detailed Information](ELFC.md) page.

Version 3
----------

* Version 3 adds support for the `signed` and `unsigned` keywords.

* This version implements a subroutine scheme for frequently used routines in the ElfC library to improve performance.

* The generated code creates a string table for improved performance.

* The stdlib defines the `size_t` type and the C library functions were updated to use this type.

* The unsigned conversion `%u` is supported by the stdio printing and scanning functions.

* Several functions were replaced by inline assembly code to remove dependencies on BIOS functions.

* The included files were cleaned up to eliminate unused definitions, and the kerneal api were moved to  a separate included file.

More information about Version 3, signed and unsigned types, library functions and ElfC internals can be found on the [ELFC Detailed Information](ELFC.md) page.

Release 3.1
------------
*  This release removes the restriction of only 2 levels of pointer indirection and supports up to 15 levels of indirection. This meets the ANSI specified minimum of 12 levels of indrection.
* This release adds support for local labels and the `goto` keyword.
* The `const` keyword is now supported.
* Functions may now return a structure or union.
* ElfC can now emit warning messages when compiling code.
* Pointers may now be initialized with non-zero constant address values, like *0xFF00*

More information about Version 3.1, labels, `goto` and `const` keywords, library functions and ElfC internals can be found on the [ELFC Detailed Information](ELFC.md) page.

Stdlib Library
--------------
**The following functions are supported in the ElfC stdlib C library.**

**Program Exit Functions**
* void abort(void);
* int atexit(int (*fn)());
* void exit(int n);

*Notes:*
* *`abort` terminates a program immediately without closing any open files.*
* *`exit` will call the function registered by `atexit`, then close any open files by calling `fclose`, and then terminate the program.*
* *`exit` deletes any temporary files created by `tmpfile` by closing them with `fclose`.*
* *Only one function can be registered by `atexit`.*


**Memory Allocation**

* void \*malloc(size_t size);

* size_t fwrite(const void \*p, size_t size, size_t count, FILE \*f);
* int fflush(FILE \*f);

*Note: Elf/OS and Mini/DOS use a write through buffer, so the fflush function is implemented as a NOP (No Operation) function*

* char \*strstr(const char \*s1, const char \*s2);
* char \*strtok(char \*s, const char \*sep);

*Note: `strlcpy` is similar to `strncpy`, except it always copies a null and it does not zero pad.*

Ctype Library
--------------
**The following functions are supported in the ElfC ctype C library.**

**Character Type Functions**

* int	isalnum(int c);
* int	isalpha(int c);
* int	iscntrl(int c);
* int	isdigit(int c);

* int	isspace(int c);
* int	isupper(int c);
* int	isxdigit(int c);
* int	tolower(int c);
* int	toupper(int c);


Assert Library
--------------

**The following function is supported in the ElfC assert C library.**

* void assert(int a, char\* file, int line);

*Notes:*
* *`assert` is implemented by a function, rather than a macro, because preprocessor macros do not support parameters.*
* *The pre-defined macros `__FILE__` and `__LINE__` should be used for the file and line arguments.*
* *If the macro `NDEBUG` is defined then the assert function returns immediately*
* *Otherwise, `assert` prints a message containing the file name and line number and then calls the `abort` function to exit.*

Stdarg Library
---------------

**The following functions are supported in the ElfC stdarg C library.**

* void	\*\*_va_start(void \*last);
* void	 \*_va_arg(void \*\*ap);
* void	  _va_end(void \*\*ap);

*Notes:*
* *The `stdarg` library is implemented by functions, because preprocessor macros do not support parameters.*
* *The `va_arg` function does not include an argument for the type.*
* *The `va_end` function is a NOP (No Operation) function.*

More information about unsupported library functions, header files and ElfC internals can be found on the [ELFC Detailed Information](ELFC.md) page.


Time Library
-------------

**The standard C time structure tm is defined by the ElfC time C library.**
```
struct tm {
    int tm_sec;       /* seconds after the minute (0 to 60) */
    int tm_min;       /* minutes after the hour (0 to 60) */
    int tm_hour;      /* hours after midnight (0 to 23) */
    int tm_mday;      /* day of the month (1 to 31) */
    int tm_mon;       /* months since January (0 to 11) */
    int tm_year;      /* years since 1900 */
    int tm_wday;      /* days since Sunday (0 to 6) */
    int tm_yday;      /* days since January 1 (0 to 365) */
    int tm_isdst;     /* Daylight Savings Time (0 => no, 1 => yes, -1 => unknown) */
};
```

**The following functions are supported in the ElfC time C library.**

* int  systime(struct tm \*tp);
* char \*asctime(struct tm \*tp);
* char \*cstime(void);
* int  strftime(char \*s, int smax, const char \*fmt, struct tm \*tp);
* void timezone(char \*tzname, int tzoff_min, int tzdst);
* int  utctime(struct tm \*tp);

*Notes:*
* Elf/OS v5 and Mini/DOS do not provide API for the time_t or clock_t variables nor is there support for timezone information, but they do support the current time through kernel API.
* Library functions that provide the clock or system time variables are not supported.
* The ElfC time library supports modified time functions that use the standard C time structure instead of the clock time or system time variables.
* The systime(struct tm \*tp) and utctime(struct tm \*tp) populate a time structure with values obtained from the kernel.
* The ElfC time library provides a timezone function to manually set the locale timezone Information and dst values used by the utctime() and strftim() functions in the C time library.
* The timezone() function should be called before to set the local values before calling other time functions.

More information about unsupported library functions, header files and ElfC internals can be found on the [ELFC Detailed Information](ELFC.md) page.

Next Release
-------------

* The `volatile` keyword should prevent optimization on that variable.

* Implement the stdlib rand() function using inline code.

* Update the preprocessor to handle Macro parameters.

* Add support to the preprocessor to accept multi-line commands.

* Add support to the preprocessor for the `#` and `##` operators.



Future Goals
-------------

* Convert library to 32-bit library and implement long, short and float data types.
* Convert the rand function in stdlib to use inline assembly code.
* Upgrade the expression stack logic to handle 32-bit data types like long and float.
* Implement double keyword as synonym for float
* Implement the C math library.
* Create a native Elf/OS (and Mini/DOS) version of ElfC that uses the native Asm/02 and Link/02 programs.


Differences Between ElfC and Full C89
-------------------------------------

*  The following keywords are not recognized:
   `double`, `float`, `long`, `short`.

*  There are four primitive data types: signed and unsigned `int` and
   signed and unsigned `char`; there are also void pointers, and there
   is limited support for `int(*)()` (pointers to functions
   of type int).

*  Arrays are limited to one dimension.

*  Old K&R-style function declarations (with parameter declarations
   between the parameter list and function body) are not
   accepted.

*  Pointers to `const` variables are supported, but neither `const` pointers
   to varying variables, nor `const` pointers to `const` variables are supported.

*  The syntax `const int * p;` is supported, but the syntaxes `int * const p;` and
   `const int * const p;` are *not* supported.

*  The `const` keyword is ignored in structures, unions and arrays.

*  The compiler does not prevent assignment of a pointer to a varying variable
   to a pointer to `const` variable.

*  There are no long integers.

*  Struct/union declarations must be separate from the declarations of
   struct/union objects, i.e. `struct p { int x, y; } q;` will not work.

*  Struct/union declarations must be global (struct and union
   objects may be declared locally, though).

*  No more than two levels of indirection are supported for pointers
   to structures and unions, i.e. pointers to a struct/union and pointers
   to pointers to a struct/union are supported.

*  A struct/union cannot be passed as an argument to a function, but a
   *pointer* to struct/union can be passed as an argument to a function.

*  There is no support for bit fields.

*  Only ints, chars, and arrays of int and char can be
   initialized in their declarations; pointers can be
   initialized with NULL or a constant address value.

*  Local arrays cannot have initializers.

*  Local declarations are limited to the beginnings of function
   bodies (they do not work in other compound statements).

*  Arguments of prototypes must be named.

*  There are no parameterized macros.

*  The `#if` and `#elif` preprocessor commands are not recognized.

*  The preprocessor does not accept multi-line commands.

*  The preprocessor does not accept comments in (some) commands.

*  The preprocessor does not recognize the `#` and `##` operators.

*  There may not be any blanks between the `#` that introduces
   a preprocessor command and the subsequent command (e.g.:
   `# define` would not be recognized as a valid command).

*  The `sizeof` operator requires parentheses.

*  Subscripting an integer with a pointer (e.g. `1["foo"]`) is
   not supported.

*  Function pointers are limited to one single type, `int(*)()`,
   and they have no argument types. Note that this declaration
   will in fact generate a pointer to `int(*)(void)`.

*  Pointers to function pointers are not supported.

*  Due to the lack of parameterized macros, `assert` and other
   macros are implemented as functions.

*  The SubC compiler accepts `//` comments in addition to `/* */`.
